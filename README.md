# What They Forgot to Teach You About Shiny Development in Production - Mohamed El Fodil Ihaddaden, HDI AG

The amount of documentation about Shiny is getting larger and larger. The official Shiny website offers a nice interface with live examples. Many books and video tutorials have been published about the subject. However, the amount of documentation and freely available knowledge about Shiny development in a production context remains scarce. As such, many Shiny developers, even the experienced once find themselves confused when starting their journey within a company that makes money using Shiny, at least at first. Indeed, while developing Shiny applications in production, there are a set of rules that should be respected in order to have the smoothest experience possible, for the developers themselves and for the stockholders too. By stockholders, I don't mean the users only, rather everyone who interact directly or indirectly with the app, for example someone might need an output that is generated through the app. Through my experience as a Shiny developer for a company that leverages Shiny in production in an extensive way, I would like to think that I have gathered an interesting amount of knowledge that will help anyone improve their Shiny development process
